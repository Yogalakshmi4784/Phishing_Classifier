This dataset contains 48 features extracted from 5000 phishing webpages and 5000 legitimate webpages, which were downloaded from January to May 2015 and from May to June 2017. An improved feature extraction technique is employed by leveraging the browser automation framework (i.e., Selenium WebDriver), which is more precise and robust compared to the parsing approach based on regular expressions.

Anti-phishing researchers and experts may find this dataset useful for phishing features analysis, conducting rapid proof of concept experiments or benchmarking phishing classification models.
